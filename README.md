# Create TSI

`create-tsi` is a generative AI RAG toolkit that generates AI Applications using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) with low code.

AI Applications generated by `create-tsi`, use LLMs hosted by T-Systems on Open Telekom Cloud.

The purpose of `create-tsi` is to make the AI Application creation process easy, flexible and fast. With `create-tsi` you can generate bots, write agents and customize them for specific use cases.

### Please Note

To get started with `create-tsi`, you need a T-Systems API key. You can request trial access via [this form](https://forms.gle/1HzUGWGG12CmCnbk6).

Once you have the key, just run

```bash
npx create-tsi@latest
```

to get started. Once your app is generated, read the generated `README.md` file to start the app.

## What you'll get

- A Next.js-powered front-end. The app is set up as a chat interface that can answer questions about your data (see below)
- **Python FastAPI** backend: You’ll get a backend powered by the [llama-index python package](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index/)
- The back-end has a single endpoint that allows you to send the state of your chat and receive additional responses

## Using your data

Unless you selected to generate a simple chat, you can supply your own data and the app will index it and be able to answer questions on the data.

Your generated app will have a folder called `data` in the `backend` directory.
The app will ingest any supported files you put in this directory.

## Example

The simplest thing to do is run `create-tsi` in interactive mode:

```bash
npx create-tsi@latest
# or
npm create tsi@latest
# or
yarn create tsi
# or
pnpm create tsi@latest
```

You will be asked for the name of your project, along with other configuration options, something like this:

```bash
>> npm create-tsi@latest
✔ What is your project named? … my-app
✔ Would you like to generate a NextJS frontend for your FastAPI (Python) backend? … No / Yes
✔ Please provide your T-Systems API key (or reuse TSI_API_KEY env variable): …
✔ Which model would you like to use? › Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
✔ Which embedding model would you like to use? › paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2
? Which data source would you like to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
   No data, just a simple chat
❯  Use an example PDF
   Use local files (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .csv)
   Use local folders
   Use website content (requires Chrome)
   Use data from a database (Mysql)
```
